  "Summary": "Boron is a metalloid chemical element with symbol B and atomic number 5. Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in both the Solar system and the Earth\u0027s crust. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals."
